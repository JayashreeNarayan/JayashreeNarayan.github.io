I am an incoming PhD candidate at FU Berlin funded by the [MSCA Doctoral Network](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/doctoral-networks) [Track the Twin](https://trackthetwin.ugent.be/). I will be working with [Prof. Cecilia Clementi](https://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/en/einrichtungen/ag/ag-clementi/index.html) and I start in September 2025!

In June 2025 I graduated from [IISER Mohali](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/) with a BS-MS dual degree in Physics. I started my journey at IISER with a profound interest in Astronomy. With this interest, I did internships at the [Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research](https://www.mps.mpg.de/en), Goettingen and the [Australian National Univeristy](https://www.anu.edu.au/), Canberra. In my final year at IISER, my interests shifted toward the dynamics of molecular systems. For my Master's thesis project, I worked at [EPFL Switzerland](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) with [Prof. Sara Bonella](https://people.epfl.ch/sara.bonella/?lang=en) at [CECAM](https://www.cecam.org/). 

My current interests include Machine Learning for Material science.
