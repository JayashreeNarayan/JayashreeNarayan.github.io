The algorithm leverages a constrained extended Lagrangian formalism to integrate the Poisson equation, promising computational advantages in highly parallelized setups. A liquid molten salt serves as the test system. The study covered the theoretical framework, system setup, and parallelization strategies used to accelerate simulations within an in-house code"],"publication":["https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20418"]},{"name":"Future Research Talent Fellow","position":"Australian National University","url":"https://science.anu.edu.au/study/scholarships/future-research-talent-awards-india","startDate":"May. 2024","endDate":"Aug. 2024","highlights":["I worked under the guidance of Prof. Christoph Feddarath at the Australian National University, Canberra, Australia, from May 2024 to August 2024, with the FRT Scholarship.
