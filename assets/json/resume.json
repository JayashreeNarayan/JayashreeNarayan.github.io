We investigate how pebble fragmentation velocity, turbulence strength, stellar metallicity, stellar mass, and orbital location affect planet growth within 1 au. Using close-in planets from NASA’s exoplanet archive, we find that turbulence plays a greater role than fragmentation velocity. While higher stellar metallicity increases the likelihood of planets reaching pebble isolation mass, stellar mass, orbital separation, and especially disc turbulence have stronger effects."},{"name":"Mass-Zero constrained molecular dynamics for electrostatic interactions","publisher":"ArXiv","releaseDate":"2025-05-26","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20418","summary":"Efficient evaluation of electrostatic forces remains a challenge in large-scale molecular dynamics. State-of-the-art particle-mesh Ewald methods scale semi-logarithmically but rely on reciprocal-space FFTs, which limit parallel performance. We present a novel real-space approach that solves the Poisson equation on a grid via an extended Lagrangian, treating field values as auxiliary zero-inertia variables with the equation enforced as a dynamical constraint. After validating the method on a toy model, we apply it to molten NaCl, reproducing structural and transport properties and demonstrating favorable performance and scalability."},{"name":"Turbulence Inference from Synthetic Observations","publisher":"ArXiv","releaseDate":"2025-09-08","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04818","summary":"This study looks at how well we can measure turbulence in star-forming clouds using CO emission lines. Earlier methods assumed the gas was transparent, but in reality, opacity and radiative transfer affect the signal. By simulating CO emission with more realistic physics, we find that turbulence measurements from CO lines are typically 10–15% too high, and in some cases up to 40% too high. We provide correction factors to make future measurements more accurate."}],"interests":[{"keywords":["atomistic ML","quantum chemistry","long-range interactions","quantum mechanics","mathematical physics","statistical mechanics","materials for quantum computing"]}],"Extracurricular Activities":[{"title":"Chief Editor","date":"2023","awarder":"NCCR MARVEL","url":"https://nccr-marvel.ch/outreach/equal-opportunities/inspire-description","summary":"I am a recipient of the NCCR-MARVEL Inspire Potentials Scholarship.
