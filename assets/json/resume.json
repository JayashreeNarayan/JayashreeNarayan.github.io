The algorithm leverages a constrained extended Lagrangian formalism to integrate the Poisson equation, promising computational advantages in highly parallelized setups. A liquid molten salt serves as the test system. The study covered the theoretical framework, system setup, and parallelization strategies used to accelerate simulations within an in-house code"]

My work was an extension of Prof. Christoph's paper in 2021 where the same work was done in an optically thin environment. The results fortify the understanding that optical thickness in clouds plays a significant role in the way clouds collapse and that optical thickness cannot be ignored."]

The results fortify the theory that the likelihood of planet formation (for close-in planets) is high when there is high pebble fragmentation, low disk turbulence, or even a very metallic star."],
